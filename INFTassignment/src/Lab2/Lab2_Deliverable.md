### Strapi
- It provides a core platform logic that developers can extend with custom built plugins.The combination of open source and headless makes it a great fit for certain companies.

#### key features
-  The community edition is free but we do need to pay for the cost on hosting, feature development and platform maintenance.

- Editors can pick different options to build a page which allows them to create unique pages with a consistent design.

#### limitations
- It is terrific if we want to create slick looking marketing brochure sites and is not intended to handle more complex use cases. 
- There are no customer roles or workflows, it is difficult to create relationship logic between slices and a developer testing is only available int eh platinum pricing tier.

After researching a few options, I tried out Prismic, Contentful, and Strapi, and decided to go with Contentful. It had a user-friendly interface, good API support, and worked well with my Handlebars project. Contentful also made it easy to manage my content and fit my project needs better overall.
