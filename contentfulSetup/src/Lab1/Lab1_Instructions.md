### Submission

-   Delete your `node_modules` folder.
-   Delete your `dist` folder.
-   Ensure your full name and student number are in the author field of your `package.json`.
-   Ensure your `README.md` has specific instructions on how to run your application.
-   Your lab writeup should be in `src/1_lab_solution.md` (or something of the sort).
    -   Ensure there is a link in your header that points to your writeup so I can easily see it.
-   Zip up all of your remaining files, name the zip with your last name and first initial, ie `kunza.zip`.
-   Put it in the dropbox before the due date.

### Instructions

-   Do a lab write-up documenting your experience using Static Site Generation (SSG).
-   The submission will be a markdown document of approximate length 1-2 pages (300-600 words), although there are no marks allocated for number of words. 
-   Read about at least 3 different template engines.  List what you think might be pro's and con's of each.  Choose 1 to use in your assignment.  Explain your choice.
-   Are there other SSG applications (other than 11ty)?  Which ones are popular?  What do you think the pro's and con's of some of the other options might be?
-   Read the configuration section of the 11ty documentation.  Which settings are we using and why?  Which settings exist that might be worth looking in to?
-   What is front matter?  How does it relate to the web?
-   Please include links to any sources that you used to find out this information.  It doesn't have to be APA or anything like that, but I'd like to know where you're getting your information from and that you actually looked yourself.
